## Testing Status

‚úÖ **Development Server:** Running on http://localhost:5174/
‚úÖ **Electron App:** Successfully loaded and running
‚úÖ **Database:** Migrations completed successfully
‚úÖ **All Services:** Initialized and running properly

## Next Steps

1. **Test the monthly filter logic** in the backend API to ensure proper date filtering
2. **Validate auto check-out functionality** by testing with sample data
3. **User acceptance testing** to ensure the simplified payment modes meet requirements
4. **Performance testing** of the auto check-out interval to ensure it doesn't impact system performance

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible with existing data
- Auto check-out feature respects manual check-outs (won't override)
- Monthly filtering may need backend API support for optimal performance
- Settings are stored in component state (consider persisting to localStorage for production)
